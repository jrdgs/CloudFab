            <p className='TextTitles'>Who are we:</p>
            <p className='Text'>We are a small team of engineers that are frustrated by the lack of access to fabrication tools and machines for personal projects, university projects, startup ideas, and prototyping generally. </p>
            <p className='TextTitles'>What makes us different:</p>
            <p className='Text'>Other companies will provide parts from a 3D model at a high cost, but we believe that engineers and makers in 2024 are capable of much more. Through the CloudFab platform, we allow engineers to interface directly with the tools they are using, putting the power of manufacturing back into your hands and saving you money at the same time.</p>
            <p className='TextTitles'>What services we offer:</p>
            <p className='Text'>Currently, we are working toward offering a browser-based CAM solution for CNC milling and CNC turning. In the future, we plan to offer a full range of fabrication and manufacturing services including 3D printing, sheet metal fabrication, tube bending and much, much more.</p>
